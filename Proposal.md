## Source Data
Data set is obtained from Stackover flow website is the complete, cleaned results of the 2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Free response submissions and personally-identifying information have been removed from the results to protect the privacy of respondents.
The survey was fielded from May 25 2021, to June 15 2021. The median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was 10.21 minutes.
Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top 5 sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, Meta posts, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it.
## Motivation and Key Questions 
I have chosen to go with is the Stackover flow survey analysis. With the 2020 pandemic, a key area of study has been the mental health of employees/developers world wide. Most companies are concerned with the employee stress level especially in a confined environment for a long time. With the survey results, I want to understand if we see an increasing mental health issues with high salaries, are mental health issues eminent with a certain experience level and is this region specific. I attempt to answer these questions through this analysis.

## Data Understanding
As most survey results are, its hard to find complete data
